# simpsons_datascience

data munging, manipulation, and correlations using data from The Simpsons

"Originally, this dataset was scraped by Tod Schenider for his post The Simpsons by the Data, for which he made the scraper 
available on GitHub. Kaggle user William Cukierski used the scraper to upload the data set, which has been rehosted here.
An additional column, chalkboard_gag, has been added to the simpsons_episodes.csv file, scraped from Simpsons Wiki."
