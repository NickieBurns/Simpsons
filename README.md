# simpsons

Reports written in Python in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that include data munging, manipulation, 
and correlations using episode data from The Simpsons using datasets provided by data-society on 
data.world.  The datasets are described as follows:

"Originally, this dataset was scraped by Tod Schenider for his post The Simpsons by the Data, for which he made the scraper 
available on GitHub. Kaggle user William Cukierski used the scraper to upload the data set, which has been rehosted here.
An additional column, chalkboard_gag, has been added to the simpsons_episodes.csv file, scraped from Simpsons Wiki."
